# LyncasChallenge
 
Hello! I'm Ruan Pasta and for this project, I'll use the framework Angular with the latest features.

For state management I'll use the RxJS. Other great option to work with state managament nowadays is Signals.

For the UI, I'll use the PrimeNG. That give us great and complete solutions for components.

For the data part, I'll use the json-server, to get a more realistic API connection, following the REST pattern.
Unfortunately, the json-server have some limitation, and this is the reason why I don't resend a request with a pagination or clear other querys when I make a request.

# Running the project
